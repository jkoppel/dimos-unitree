It specifies the path to the multimodal projection model used by the chat handler.\n\nExplanation: The `mmproj` parameter (line 25) provides the path to the CLIP model, which is used by `Llava15ChatHandler` (line 26) to process image data. The main language model is specified by `model_path`, and GPU acceleration is controlled by the `gpu` boolean flag.",
