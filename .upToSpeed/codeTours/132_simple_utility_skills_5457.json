      "description": "In `speak.py`, what is the primary function of the global `_audio_queue`?\n\nOptions:\n\n A). To manage a pool of worker threads, improving performance by reusing threads for TTS conversion.\n\nB). To serialize audio playback, ensuring that only one speech task runs at a time to prevent overlapping sound.\n\nC). To allow the main thread to continue execution without blocking, by offloading the entire task to a background process.\n\nD). To buffer TTS results before they are retrieved, in case the calling thread is busy.\n\n\nCorrect: B). To serialize audio playback, ensuring that only one speech task runs at a time to prevent overlapping sound.\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is the second option. The `_audio_queue` is a standard FIFO (First-In, First-Out) queue. Its main purpose here is to ensure that requests to speak are processed one by one. If multiple requests were processed at the same time, the audio outputs would overlap and become unintelligible. The queue enforces sequential execution. The first option is incorrect because the code uses a single, persistent background thread, not a pool. The third option is also not quite right, as the calling thread eventually blocks on `result_queue.get()` to wait for the operation to complete. The queue organizes the work, but does not eliminate the wait. The final option describes a general property of queues, but its specific function in this context is serialization, not just buffering.",
