First, we will examine the `find_nearest_free_cell` function, which ensures that the path's start and end points are valid. Then, we will take a closer look at the `astar` function, breaking down its process, including how it handles invalid start and end positions, its main loop, and how it reconstructs the path.\n\nLet's begin by examining the `find_nearest_free_cell` function.",

      "description": "The `find_nearest_free_cell` function is a utility used by the **A* pathfinding algorithm**. It is designed to find the nearest valid, or \"free,\" cell on the costmap within a specified maximum distance from a given starting point. This is particularly important when the initial start or goal positions for the pathfinding algorithm are in an occupied space, as it ensures that the algorithm can begin and end in a valid location.\n\nThe function takes the following arguments:\n\n- `costmap`: A `Costmap` object representing the environment\n- `position`: The starting position to search from\n- `cost_threshold`: The cost value above which a cell is considered occupied\n- `max_search_radius`: The maximum distance to search for a free cell\n\nThe function returns a tuple `(x, y)` representing the coordinates of the nearest free cell, or the original position if no free cell is found.",
