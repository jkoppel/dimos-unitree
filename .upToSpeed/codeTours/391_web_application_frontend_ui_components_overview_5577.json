The `History.svelte` component is responsible for laying out the historical entries. As it loops through each command, it uses the `<Ps1 />` component to render the prompt part. `Ps1.svelte` itself just knows how to draw one prompt; `History.svelte` is what places it correctly within the list of past commands. The other components have different jobs: `Input.svelte` handles the live command line, and `StreamViewer.svelte` manages video feeds.",
