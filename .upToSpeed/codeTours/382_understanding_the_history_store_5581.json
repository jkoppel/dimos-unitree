      "description": "In `history.ts`, the `history` store is a Svelte `writable` store designed to keep track of command history. It cleverly interacts with the browser's `localStorage` to ensure that the command history persists even after the user closes or reloads the page. Let's break down how it works.",

      "description": "The `history` store is created using the `writable` function from `Svelte`'s store module. This makes `history` a reactive store, meaning that any components subscribed to it will automatically update when its value changes.\n\nThe store is initialized with an array of `Command` objects. It attempts to load the initial state from `localStorage` by reading the value associated with the key `'history'`. If no such item exists in `localStorage` (or if it's empty), it defaults to an empty array `[]`. This is achieved through the following code.",

      "description": "To ensure that the command history is saved across sessions, the `history` store subscribes to its own changes. The `subscribe` method takes a function that runs whenever the store's value is updated.\n\nIn this case, the function provided to `subscribe` takes the new `value` of the store and saves it to `localStorage`. The value is first converted to a JSON string using `JSON.stringify` before being stored under the key `'history'`. This guarantees that any modification to the `history` store is immediately persisted.",

Since `localStorage.getItem('history')` returns `null` when the item does not exist, the logical OR `||` operator provides the default string `'[]'`. `JSON.parse('[]')` then converts this string into an empty JavaScript array `[]`, which becomes the initial value of the store. This prevents runtime errors and ensures the store starts with a valid, empty array.",
