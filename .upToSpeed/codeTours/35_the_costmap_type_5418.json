A costmap is a 2D grid that represents the environment, where each cell has a \"cost\" that indicates how difficult or dangerous it is to traverse. This information is used for path planning and obstacle avoidance.\n\nWe'll be exploring the `dimos/types/costmap.py` file to understand how it all works.",
