What is the most likely reason for this issue?\n\nOptions:\n\n A). The `autoprefixer` plugin in `postcss.config.js` is not configured to process files outside the `src` directory.\n\nB). The `content` array in `tailwind.config.js` does not include the `lib/` directory, so Tailwind did not scan the new file for classes.\n\nC). A new plugin for handling `.svelte` files must be added to the `plugins` array in `tailwind.config.js`.\n\n\nCorrect: B). The `content` array in `tailwind.config.js` does not include the `lib/` directory, so Tailwind did not scan the new file for classes.\n\nExplanation: The `content` array in `tailwind.config.js` directs Tailwind's Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler to scan specific files for class names. If a file containing utility classes is not included in these paths, its classes will be purged from the final CSS output, causing the component to be unstyled. The other configurations are not responsible for file scanning; `autoprefixer` adds vendor prefixes to existing CSS, and Tailwind plugins extend functionality, but do not determine which files are scanned.",
