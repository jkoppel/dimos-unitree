To defensively parse potentially incomplete or malformed JSON strings from the model's output, preventing `JSONDecodeError` and salvaging partial data.\n\nD).

To defensively parse potentially incomplete or malformed JSON strings from the model's output, preventing `JSONDecodeError` and salvaging partial data.\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is that the function defensively parses malformed JSON. The logic, particularly `json_like_str.rfind(',\"object')` and the subsequent string manipulation, is designed to fix truncated JSON strings returned by the language model. This prevents `json.JSONDecodeError` and allows the system to extract valid data even from an imperfect model response.
