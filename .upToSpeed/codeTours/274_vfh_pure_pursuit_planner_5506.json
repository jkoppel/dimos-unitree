After that, we will analyze the core logic in `_compute_velocity_commands`, followed by a detailed look at the VFH algorithm, the decision-making process, velocity calculation, collision checking, and finally, how the visualization is updated.",

It takes the `costmap`, which contains obstacle information, and builds a polar histogram.\n\nEach bin in the histogram corresponds to a direction around the robot. The value in each bin represents the \"cost\" or \"danger\" of moving in that direction. Higher values mean more obstacles. The method weights obstacles by the inverse square of their distance, so closer obstacles have a much larger impact.\n\nFinally, it calls `_smooth_histogram` (**line 254**) to reduce noise and make it easier to find clear paths.",

It identifies the direction most aligned with the goal and only considers other options if that path is blocked by an obstacle in the histogram.\n\nC).

It calculates a total cost for each possible direction by combining weighted costs for obstacle avoidance, goal-seeking, and maintaining a smooth path, then selects the direction with the lowest cost.\n\nExplanation: The correct answer accurately describes the process in `select_direction`. The method calculates `total_costs` (line 283) as a sum of `obstacle_costs`, `goal_costs`, and `prev_costs`. This integrated cost function allows the planner to balance competing objectives—avoiding obstacles, moving toward the goal, and ensuring a smooth trajectory—before selecting the direction with the minimum cost. The other options describe plausible but incorrect strategies. The planner does not prioritize the goal direction exclusively, nor does it only consider obstacle density. It evaluates all factors simultaneously.",
