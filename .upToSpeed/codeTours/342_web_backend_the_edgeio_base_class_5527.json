Based on the design of `EdgeIO`, what is the intended way to manage the lifecycle of these subscriptions to ensure reliable cleanup?\n\nOptions:\n\n A). Store each subscription in a separate instance variable and create a custom `shutdown` method in `KafkaConsumer` to call `dispose()` on each one individually.\n\nB). Add each subscription's disposable object to the `self.disposables` container. This allows a single call to `dispose_all` to terminate all of them.\n\nC). The `reactivex` library automatically disposes of subscriptions when the `KafkaConsumer` object is garbage collected, so no explicit management is needed.\n\nD). Re-implement the `__init__` method in `KafkaConsumer` to create a new, separate `CompositeDisposable`, overriding the one from `EdgeIO`.\n\n\nCorrect: B). Add each subscription's disposable object to the `self.disposables` container. This allows a single call to `dispose_all` to terminate all of them.\n\nExplanation: The correct approach is to add each subscription to the `self.disposables` container provided by the `EdgeIO` base class. This leverages the intended pattern, where `dispose_all` can clean up all managed resources in one call. Creating custom logic is redundant, relying on automatic garbage collection for external resources is unreliable, and overriding the parent's `disposables` defeats the purpose of the base class design.",
