In Python, an `except` block for a parent exception class will also catch all of its child classes (subclasses). Since `DataNotFoundError` inherits from `DataRetrievalError`, which in turn inherits from `AgentMemoryError`, it is caught by `except AgentMemoryError:`. `Exception` is a parent class, not a child, and `ValueError` is an unrelated built-in exception.",
