If it does, it loops through each `key` in the list and renders a dedicated container (`<div>`) for it. Each container includes a title derived from the key, a message area, and connection buttons. This allows the backend to control which text streams are available on the front-end by simply passing a list of keys.",

Inside each container, it generates a title and an `<img>` element with a unique `id` (e.g., `img_front_camera`). The `src` attribute is initially empty, waiting for JavaScript to activate the stream. This approach makes it easy to add or remove video feeds from the dashboard by modifying the `stream_keys` list in the backend.",
