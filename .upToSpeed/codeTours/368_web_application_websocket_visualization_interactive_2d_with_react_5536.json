The transformation functions fail to update when the component's container is resized, as the scales are only calculated once.\n\nB). If the state contains multiple `Costmap` objects with conflicting coordinate systems, the visualization's mapping will be determined by the first one found, potentially misaligning other data.\n\nC). The component will throw an error if it tries to render a `Path` or `Vector` before a `Costmap` is present in the state.\n\nD). Any update to the `state` object forces a full recalculation of the D3 scales, even if the reference `Costmap` remains unchanged.\n\n\nCorrect: B).

The logic on lines 42-44 explicitly finds the *first* `Costmap` and uses it as the single source of truth for the entire coordinate system. If other `Costmap` objects with different origins or resolutions are present, they will be rendered, but all `Path` and `Vector` objects will be transformed according to that first map, leading to potential misalignment. The other options are incorrect: the transforms *do* update on resize because `width` and `height` are dependencies; the rendering functions for paths and vectors have fallbacks for when `worldToPx` is undefined; and `useMemo` prevents recalculation as long as its dependencies (the reference costmap's properties) don't change.",
