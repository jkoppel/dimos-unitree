The CSS is processed by the bundler and injected into the DOM, ensuring styles are applied before the component renders.\n\nB). The styles are loaded asynchronously, separate from the main JavaScript bundle, to optimize initial page load.\n\nC). The import scopes the CSS rules exclusively to the `App.svelte` component.\n\nD). It instructs the browser to fetch `app.css` only after the `App` component has been fully mounted.\n\n\nCorrect: A). The CSS is processed by the bundler and injected into the DOM, ensuring styles are applied before the component renders.\n\nExplanation: Correct. Importing the CSS file directly into the JavaScript entry point allows the bundler (like Vite or Webpack) to include the styles in the build process. It typically injects a `<style>` tag into the HTML `<head>`, ensuring the styles are present before the Svelte component mounts. This prevents a 'flash of unstyled content' (FOUC).
