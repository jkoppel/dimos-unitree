To ensure every planner directly interfaces with the costmap for collision checks within the velocity computation.\n\n\nCorrect: B). To separate the algorithm-specific motion calculation from the common planning logic (e.g., waypoint management, state tracking) handled by the base class.\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The primary purpose of making `_compute_velocity_commands` abstract is to create a template. The `BaseLocalPlanner` handles common, algorithm-agnostic tasks like waypoint tracking, state management, and triggering recovery. The specific algorithm for how to move the robot (e.g., DWA, VFH) is implemented by a subclass inside `_compute_velocity_commands`. Option A is incorrect because stuck detection and recovery are handled by concrete methods (`check_if_stuck`, `execute_recovery_behavior`) in the base class. Option C is incorrect because `plan` is the public entry point that orchestrates the logic and then calls `_compute_velocity_commands`. Option D is incorrect because while the velocity computation uses collision data, the base class already provides the necessary interfaces (`get_costmap`, `check_collision`); the abstract method's role is to define *where* the algorithm-specific logic goes, not to enforce how it gets its data.",
