It produces a value when either stream emits something.\n\nD). It waits for a new frame and a new query to arrive together.\n\n\nCorrect: B). It produces a value only when a new query arrives from `text_query_stream`.\n\nExplanation: The correct choice is the second one. The `pipe` is called on `text_query_stream`, so it acts as the driver. `with_latest_from` waits for an emission from this source stream and then combines it with the most recent value from `safe_data_stream`. The other behaviors describe different operators; for instance, the last option is similar to how `zip` works.",

It enables a tight feedback loop where a planning agent's queries (text) are fused with an execution agent's observations (video frames). This fusion of symbolic queries and sensor data closes the perception-action cycle, allowing the agent to reason about and act upon its environment in real-time.",
