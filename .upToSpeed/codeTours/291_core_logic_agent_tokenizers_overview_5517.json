It allows the underlying model provider to be changed by injecting a different tokenizer implementation, without requiring modifications to the `OpenAIAgent` or `PromptBuilder`.\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is the first option. The primary benefit of the `AbstractTokenizer` interface is that it decouples the agent and prompt builder from concrete tokenizer implementations. This allows developers to swap backends (e.g., from OpenAI to Hugging Face) by simply providing a different tokenizer that adheres to the abstract interface, without changing the agent's code.
