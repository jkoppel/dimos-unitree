It allows the `self.agents` attribute to be `None` if no argument is passed.\n\nD). It optimizes performance by reusing the same empty list across all instances.\n\n\nCorrect: A). It ensures that instances created without an `agents` argument do not share the same list object.\n\nExplanation: In Python, default arguments are evaluated once when the function is defined. If a mutable object like `[]` were used as a default, all `AgentConfig` instances created without an argument would share the same list. Modifying the list in one instance would affect all others. The pattern `agents if agents is not None else []` creates a new empty list for each instance that needs one, which is usually the intended behavior.",
