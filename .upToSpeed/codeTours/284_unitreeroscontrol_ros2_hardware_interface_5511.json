This generic **enum** defines five states: `UNKNOWN` for uninitialized conditions, `INITIALIZING` during startup, `IDLE` when ready for commands, `MOVING` during command execution, and `ERROR` for fault conditions. This abstraction allows different robots to map their hardware-specific states to common software states.",
