It is a wrapper class that instantiates either a `FastAPIServer` or `FlaskServer` based on configuration.\n\nB). It acts as a base class for `FastAPIServer` and `FlaskServer`, providing a common mechanism for managing the lifecycle of stream subscriptions.\n\nC). It directly handles the encoding of video frames for streaming, abstracting this logic away from the web server classes.\n\nD). It serves as a utility for the HTML templates to dynamically generate URLs for the data streams.\n\n\nCorrect: B). It acts as a base class for `FastAPIServer` and `FlaskServer`, providing a common mechanism for managing the lifecycle of stream subscriptions.\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is that `EdgeIO` serves as a base class. Both `FastAPIServer` and `FlaskServer` inherit from it, as shown in their class definitions. `EdgeIO` provides the `dispose_all` method, which uses a `CompositeDisposable` to manage the lifecycle of reactive stream subscriptions, ensuring resources are cleaned up properly. The other options are incorrect: `RobotWebInterface` is the high-level wrapper, frame processing is handled within the server classes' reactive pipelines, and URL generation is a function of the web framework's routing and templating engine.",
