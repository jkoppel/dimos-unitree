By directly interacting with the `depth_model` attribute after it's loaded.\n\nD). By modifying the `intrinsic` list and re-instantiating the class for each image.\n\n\nCorrect: B). By calling the `infer_depth(img)` method on an instance of `Metric3D`.\n\nExplanation: The correct way to get a depth map is by calling the `infer_depth(img)` method, which is the designated public interface for this functionality. The constructor (`__init__`) is for setting up the model, not for processing images. Interacting directly with the `depth_model` would bypass necessary pre-processing and post-processing steps handled within `infer_depth`.
