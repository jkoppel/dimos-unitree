      "description": "This tour explores the `StreamBase` abstraction, which is designed to separate the concerns of data streaming from the core simulation logic. While a simulator's primary role is to create and manage a virtual environment, streaming is about encoding and transmitting data from that environment to an external consumer. This separation allows for modularity, where different simulators can be paired with various streaming configurations without altering the core simulation code.",

For example, **`rgb`** will stream color images, while **`normals`** will stream surface normal data.\n- **Streaming Parameters (`transport`, `rtsp_url`)**: These parameters configure the streaming protocol. `transport` sets the transport protocol (TCP or UDP), and `rtsp_url` provides the endpoint for the RTSP stream.\n- **Simulator Instance (`simulator`)**: This parameter holds a reference to a `SimulatorBase` instance, which is the bridge that allows the streamer to interact with the simulation environment.",

Methods like `_load_stage` and `_setup_camera` are abstract, meaning they must be implemented by a concrete subclass. These methods are intended to use the `self.simulator` object to interact with the simulation environment.\n\nFor example, a concrete implementation of `_load_stage` would call methods on `self.simulator` to load a 3D scene (`USD` file) into the simulation. Similarly, `_setup_camera` would use `self.simulator` to create and configure a camera at the specified `camera_path`. This design delegates simulator-specific tasks to the `StreamBase` subclass while keeping the core streaming logic in the base class.",

      "description": "Interestingly, while many methods are abstract, `_setup_ffmpeg` is a concrete method. The `_setup_ffmpeg` method is implemented in the base class because `FFmpeg` is a common, external tool used for video encoding and streaming. The command constructed here sets up an `FFmpeg` process that takes raw video data, encodes it using the H.264 codec (specifically with NVIDIA's hardware acceleration, `h264_nvenc`), and streams it over RTSP.\n\nBy providing a concrete implementation for this part of the pipeline, `StreamBase` establishes a standardized way of handling video encoding and transmission, regardless of the underlying simulator. The `-i -` argument tells `FFmpeg` to read from standard input, which is how the generated frames will be passed to it.",
