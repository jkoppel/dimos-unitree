It directly calls `history.update()` to append incoming text data to the last command's output.\n\nC). It modifies a shared state object that both the `textStreamStore` and `history` stores reference.\n\n\nCorrect: B). It directly calls `history.update()` to append incoming text data to the last command's output.\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is that `connectTextStream` directly updates the `history` store. The code on lines 142-152 explicitly calls `history.update()`, takes the last history entry, and appends the new event data to its `outputs` array. The other options describe plausible but incorrect state management patterns for this specific implementation; there is no event bus or shared mutable object in use here.",
