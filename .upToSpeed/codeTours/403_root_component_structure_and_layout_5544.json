They are arranged horizontally by default and switch to a vertical stack on medium screens and larger.\n\nB). They are stacked vertically by default and switch to a horizontal arrangement on medium screens and larger.\n\nC). They are hidden on small screens and only appear on medium screens and larger.\n\nD). The entire main component, including `StreamViewer` and `History`, switches from vertical to horizontal.\n\n\nCorrect: B). They are stacked vertically by default and switch to a horizontal arrangement on medium screens and larger.\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is that the components are stacked vertically by default and switch to horizontal on medium screens. The class `flex-col` sets the default layout to a vertical column. The `md:flex-row` class is a responsive prefix that overrides the default on screens that are medium size or larger, changing the layout to a horizontal row. The other options are incorrect because the classes only apply to the `div` containing `Ps1` and `Input`, not the entire component, and they do not control visibility.",
