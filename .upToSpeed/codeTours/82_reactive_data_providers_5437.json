Only the first component to subscribe would receive data; all others would receive nothing.\n\nB). Each subscriber would trigger a new, independent execution of the upstream pipeline, causing redundant processing.\n\nC). The stream would automatically buffer data and deliver it to new subscribers when they join.\n\nD).

Each subscriber would trigger a new, independent execution of the upstream pipeline, causing redundant processing.\n\nExplanation: The `ops.share()` operator converts a \"cold\" observable into a \"hot\" one. Without it, the observable is cold, meaning it starts executing its pipeline from scratch for every new subscriber. This would cause the `observe_on` and `do_action` logic to be duplicated for each consumer. Option 1 is incorrect; all subscribers would receive data, but from separate pipelines. Option 3 describes the behavior of operators like `replay`. Option 4 is incorrect; an observable can have multiple subscribers without `share()`, but it leads to inefficient re-execution.",
