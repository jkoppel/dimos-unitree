It enforces that the robot must be configured with exactly one of two mutually exclusive providers for control and video data (ROS or WebRTC).\n\nExplanation: The XOR (`^`) operator returns true only when its operands are different. The `if not (use_ros ^ use_webrtc)` condition, therefore, triggers an error if both flags are the same (both `True` or both `False`). This enforces the design constraint that the robot must operate using either ROS or WebRTC, but not both or neither, as they are mutually exclusive control and data sources.",
