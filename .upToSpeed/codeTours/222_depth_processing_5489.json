To match the output dimensions of the final depth map after it is generated.\n\n\nCorrect: A). To maintain the correct geometric relationship between the camera's focal length/principal point and the resized image dimensions.\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is that scaling the intrinsics maintains the geometric integrity of the camera model relative to the resized image. Camera intrinsics (fx, fy, cx, cy) define the camera's projection properties. When the image is resized by a certain factor, these parameters must also be scaled by the same factor to ensure that the relationship between 3D world points and 2D image points remains accurate for the new image size. The other options are incorrect because normalization is a separate step, the scaling is for the *input* not the output, and it is not a performance optimization for the normalization step.",
