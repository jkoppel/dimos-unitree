      "description": "Let's explore how `ObjectDetectionStream` wires raw video frames into a reactive detection pipeline.\n\nFirst, a quick primer on `RxPY`: An **Observable** is a data source that emits items over time. You can transform these emissions using `.pipe(ops.map(fn))`, which applies function `fn` to each emitted item, creating a new stream of transformed data.\n\nNow let's see how this reactive pattern powers the object detection pipeline.",

This gives it access to all the instance configuration like `self.detector`, `self.min_confidence`, and `self.depth_model` without needing them as parameters.\n\nThe pipeline is created with `video_stream.pipe(ops.map(process_frame))`, which applies our nested function to each incoming video frame.",

      "description": "In `create_stream`, the `process_frame` function is defined as a nested function. What is the primary architectural reason for this design?\n\nOptions:\n\n A). It is a Python requirement that functions used with `reactivex.operators.map` must be defined within the same local scope.\n\nB). This creates a closure, allowing `process_frame` to access the instance's `self` (e.g., `self.detector`, `self.min_confidence`) when applied to each frame in the stream.\n\nC). To ensure `process_frame` is automatically garbage-collected after the stream is created, optimizing memory usage.\n\n\nCorrect: B). This creates a closure, allowing `process_frame` to access the instance's `self` (e.g., `self.detector`, `self.min_confidence`) when applied to each frame in the stream.\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is that nesting `process_frame` creates a closure. A closure 'closes over' the variables from its enclosing scope—in this case, the `self` instance of `ObjectDetectionStream`. This allows the `process_frame` function, when called by the `ops.map` operator, to access all the necessary configuration and models (like `self.detector` and `self.depth_model`) without needing them passed in as arguments. The other options are incorrect: `ops.map` can accept any callable, and this pattern doesn't primarily relate to garbage collection.",
