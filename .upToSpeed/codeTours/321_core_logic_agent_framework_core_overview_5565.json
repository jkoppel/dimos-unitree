To prevent all `AgentConfig` instances from sharing the same list object if initialized without arguments.\n\nC). To improve performance by avoiding the creation of an empty list for every new instance.\n\nD). To enforce that the `agents` parameter strictly adheres to the `List[Agent]` type hint at runtime.\n\n\nCorrect: B). To prevent all `AgentConfig` instances from sharing the same list object if initialized without arguments.\n\nExplanation: The correct implementation `self.agents = agents if agents is not None else []` avoids the common Python pitfall of mutable default arguments. If `__init__(self, agents: List[Agent] = [])` were used, the empty list `[]` would be created once when the function is defined and shared across all subsequent calls that don't provide the `agents` argument. This would cause different `AgentConfig` instances to unintentionally modify the same list.
