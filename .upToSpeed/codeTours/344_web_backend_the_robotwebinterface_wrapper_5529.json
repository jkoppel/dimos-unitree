It acts as a convenience wrapper, pre-configuring `FastAPIServer` with sensible defaults for a specific use case.\n\nC). It replaces the core logic of `FastAPIServer` with a more optimized implementation for embedded systems.\n\nD).

Its purpose is not to add new functionality or replace core logic, but to simplify the setup process by providing a specialized configuration, which is a common use of the Wrapper pattern.",
