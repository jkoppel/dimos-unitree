This function's main job is to take the raw output from a detection model like `YOLO` and transform it into a standardized format. It iterates through the detection results, extracting bounding boxes, tracking IDs (if available), class IDs, confidences, and class names.\n\nNotice how it handles cases where tracking information might not be present by assigning a default `track_id` of -1 (lines 99-101). It also has built-in filtering capabilities, allowing you to specify which classes, names, or track IDs to keep.",

It takes lists of detection attributes and applies filters based on `class_filter`, `name_filter`, or `track_id_filter`. This is very flexible and is used in the **YOLO** example to filter for `person` detections.",
