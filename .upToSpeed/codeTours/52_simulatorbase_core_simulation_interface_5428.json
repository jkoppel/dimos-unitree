To allow the abstract interface to pass backend-specific configurations to the appropriate concrete implementation, supporting different initialization paradigms.\n\nExplanation: `SimulatorBase` is designed for flexibility. Including optional, backend-specific parameters like `open_usd` and `entities` allows the common interface to serve different concrete simulators, each with unique initialization needs. The concrete class (e.g., `IsaacSimulator`) will use the parameters relevant to it and ignore the others.
