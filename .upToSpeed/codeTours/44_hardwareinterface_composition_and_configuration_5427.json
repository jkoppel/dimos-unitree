A `KeyError` is raised because the 'end_effector' and 'sensors' keys are missing from the configuration dictionary.\n\nB). The original `end_effector` and `sensors` are preserved, and only the `arm_architecture` is updated.\n\nC). The `end_effector` and `sensors` attributes are reset to `None` because they were not provided.\n\nD). The `sensors` attribute is preserved, but the `end_effector` is set to `None`.\n\n\nCorrect: B). The original `end_effector` and `sensors` are preserved, and only the `arm_architecture` is updated.\n\nExplanation: The `set_configuration` method uses `configuration.get(key, default)`. If a key is not found in the input dictionary, this method returns the provided default value. In this implementation, the default value is the current attribute (e.g., `self.end_effector`). This allows for partial updates, preserving any component not explicitly specified in the configuration dictionary. Therefore, only the `arm_architecture` is updated, while the other attributes remain unchanged.",
