Inside the `while True` loop are three key steps:\n\n1. `self.scene.step()` on line `81` advances the simulation\n2. `self.camera.render()` gets the rendered image. The method can render different annotator types based on the conditional logic in lines `86-91`: if `annotator_type` is `'rgb'`, it calls `render(rgb=True)`, if it's `'normals'`, it calls `render(normal=True)`\n3. `self.proc.stdin.write()` on line `98` writes the frame to the `FFmpeg` process for streaming",

To prevent the `stream` method from starting before the simulator is built.\n\n\nCorrect: A). To ensure the camera is part of the scene graph before the simulation environment is fully constructed.\n\nExplanation: The `simulator.build()` method finalizes the simulation scene. By calling it after `_setup_camera()`, we ensure that the camera object created and added to `self.scene` is included in the final, operational simulation graph. The other setup methods must also complete before the build to ensure their components are included.",
