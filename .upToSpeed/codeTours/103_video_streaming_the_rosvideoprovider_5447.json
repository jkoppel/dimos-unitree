The `_subject` is already an `Observable`. This method simply returns the `_subject` and applies a few standard operators.\n\n`subscribe_on` and `observe_on` manage the threading, while `share()` makes the stream **\"hot,\"** or multicast.

In a push-based system where the source might send data too quickly, you can control the flow with operators.\n\nTo implement **rate limiting**, you could add an operator like `ops.throttle_first(1.0 / fps)` into the `pipe`. This would only allow the first frame within each time interval `(1.0 / fps)` to pass, effectively throttling the stream to the desired frame rate.",
