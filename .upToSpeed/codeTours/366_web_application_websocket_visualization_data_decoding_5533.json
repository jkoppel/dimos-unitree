Implement a static `Polygon.decode` method. The central `decode` function will automatically use it based on the class name.\n\nB). Add `EncodedPolygon` to the `EncodedSomething` union type. The decoding logic is then handled generically by the base `Encoded<T>` type.\n\nC).

Implement a static `Polygon.decode` method, add `EncodedPolygon` to the `EncodedSomething` union, and add a conditional block for the `\"polygon\"` type to the main `decode` function.\n\nExplanation: The correct approach requires three modifications. First, the `Polygon` class needs its own static `decode` method to handle its specific data structure. Second, the `EncodedPolygon` type must be added to the `EncodedSomething` union to ensure type safety throughout the application.
