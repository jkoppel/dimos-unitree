      "description": "In `dimos/web/dimos_interface/src/utils/tracking.ts`, the `track` function is a simple utility that acts as a wrapper around the `umami` analytics library. Its purpose is to log user-entered commands and their arguments, which helps developers understand how the application is being used. The function is designed to be resilient; it first checks for the existence of `window.umami` before attempting to track an event, which prevents runtime errors if the analytics script hasn't loaded.",

      "description": "What is the behavior of the `track` function if the `umami` analytics script fails to load or is blocked?\n\nOptions:\n\n A). It throws a runtime error, halting further execution.\n\nB). It takes no action, and the application continues running normally.\n\nC). It logs a warning message to the browser's console.\n\nD). It queues the event and retries sending it after a short delay.\n\n\nCorrect: B). It takes no action, and the application continues running normally.\n\nExplanation: The function's logic is wrapped in a conditional check: `if (window.umami)` on line 26. If the `umami` object is not available on the `window` (for instance, if an ad-blocker blocks the script), the condition evaluates to false, and the code block containing the `window.umami.track()` call is never executed. This prevents any errors and allows the application to proceed without interruption.",
