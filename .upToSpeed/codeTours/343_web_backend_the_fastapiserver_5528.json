For each client that connects to a video feed, this function is called.\n\nIt works by creating a `queue.Queue` to act as a buffer between the reactive stream and the HTTP response. A new subscription is made to the appropriate `active_streams` observable, and incoming frames are put into the queue (line 128).\n\nThe `generate` inner function then runs in a loop, pulling frames from the queue (line 136) and `yield`-ing them in the `multipart/x-mixed-replace` format. This decouples the frame arrival (which is asynchronous and controlled by the source stream) from the HTTP response generation, which must block until a frame is available. The `timeout=1` on `frame_queue.get()` prevents the server from blocking indefinitely if the stream stops.",

In each iteration, it tries to get a message from the queue. If a message is found, it's yielded as a JSON object in the SSE format.
